# Usage Example: Build City Assets and Scene Objects from CSV

This example shows how an agent can take a multi-step Unity task, generate the required scripts, import structured data, create assets, update the active scene, and verify the result.

## What this example demonstrates

- Creating Unity scripts from a prompt
- Importing CSV data into ScriptableObject assets
- Building scene content automatically in the active scene
- Reusing existing project assets such as sprites
- Validating the final scene state after the changes

## User prompt

```text
Add following feature to Unity using execute script tool:

- Read cities list from csv file #file:cities.csv
- Create CitySO ScriptableObject class with properties based on csv columns, place it in Assets/Scripts/ScriptableObjects
- Create assets for each city in the csv file, populate properties with data from the file, place them in Assets/ScriptableObjects
- Create CityComponent MonoBehaviour class with a reference to CitySO ScriptableObject and place it in Assets/Scripts
- Create Map root gameobject in the current scene
- For each city asset, create a City gameobject as a child of Map, set its position based on the coordinates from the asset, add CityComponent and assign the corresponding CitySO asset
- To each City gameObject add SpriteRenderer component and assign a default sprite from Assets/Images/City.png
```

## Outcome

The agent completed the full "cities from CSV to scene" workflow.

- Added `CitySO` ScriptableObject: `CitySO.cs`
- Added `CityComponent` MonoBehaviour: `CityComponent.cs`
- Added the CSV data file: `cities.csv`
- Ran an Editor execution script that:
  - Created 49 `CitySO` assets in `Assets/ScriptableObjects`
  - Created a `Map` root GameObject in the active scene with 49 `City` children
  - Set each city position from `Coordinates`
  - Added `CityComponent` and assigned the matching `CitySO`
  - Added `SpriteRenderer` and assigned the default sprite from `City.png`

- Create CitySO ScriptableObject class with properties based on csv columns, place it in Assets/Scripts/ScriptableObjects
- Create assets for each city in the csv file, populate properties with data from the file, place them in Assets/ScriptableObjects
- Create CityComponent MonoBehaviour class with a reference to CitySO ScriptableObject and place it in Assets/Scripts
- Create Map root gameobject in the current scene
- For each city asset, create a City gameobject as a child of Map, set its position based on the coordinates from the asset, add CityComponent and assign the corresponding CitySO asset
- To each City gameObject add SpriteRenderer component and assign a default sprite from Assets/Images/City.png

I’m going to (1) locate or add `cities.csv`, (2) add the `CitySO` + `CityComponent` scripts in the requested folders, then (3) run a Unity Editor script to import the CSV, create the ScriptableObject assets, and build the `Map` + `City` GameObjects with sprite renderers in the current scene.

- Searched for files matching `**/cities.csv`, 1 match
- Read Assets
- Searched for files matching `**/Assets/**/City.png*`, no matches
- Read Assets/Images
- Read Assets/Plugins/UnityCodeMcpServer/Documentation~/Examples/cities.csv
- Created Assets/Scripts/ScriptableObjects/CitySO.cs
- Created Assets/Scripts/CityComponent.cs
- Created Assets/Resources/cities.csv

Next I’ll run a Unity Editor execution script that imports cities.csv, creates or updates `CitySO` assets in `Assets/ScriptableObjects`, and builds the `Map` + `City` GameObjects with `CityComponent` and `SpriteRenderer` in the current scene.

static class CitiesImporter
{
    private const string CsvAssetPath = "Assets/Resources/cities.csv";
    private const string CityAssetsFolder = "Assets/ScriptableObjects";
    private const string DefaultSpritePath = "Assets/Images/City.png";

    public static object Run()
    {
        AssetDatabase.Refresh();

        var start = DateTime.UtcNow;
        while (EditorApplication.isCompiling)
        {
            if ((DateTime.UtcNow - start).TotalSeconds > 60)
                throw new Exception("Unity is still compiling after 60s. Re-run the script once compilation finishes.");
            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(200);
        }

        var citySoType = typeof(CitySO);
        var cityComponentType = typeof(CityComponent);

        EnsureFolder(CityAssetsFolder);

    // ... rest of import utility omitted for brevity
}
return CitiesImporter.Run();
```

Full script: [CitiesImporter.cs](CitiesImporter.cs)

- Checked Assets/Scripts/ScriptableObjects/CitySO.cs and Assets/Scripts/CityComponent.cs, no problems found
- Read Assets/ScriptableObjects
- Ran `execute_csharp_script_in_unity_editor`

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

var scene = SceneManager.GetActiveScene();
GameObject map = null;
foreach (var root in scene.GetRootGameObjects())
{
    if (root != null && root.name == "Map")
    {
        map = root;
        break;
    }
}

if (map == null)
    return "Map not found in active scene.";

return $"Map found. Child count: {map.transform.childCount}.";
```

Implemented the full "cities from CSV to scene" pipeline.

- Added `CitySO` ScriptableObject: `CitySO.cs`
- Added `CityComponent` MonoBehaviour: `CityComponent.cs`
- Added the CSV data file: `cities.csv`
- Ran an Editor execution script that:
  - Created 49 `CitySO` assets in `Assets/ScriptableObjects`
  - Created a `Map` root GameObject in the active scene with 49 `City` children
  - Set each city position from `Coordinates`, added `CityComponent` and assigned the matching `CitySO`
  - Added `SpriteRenderer` to each city and assigned the default sprite from `City.png`
