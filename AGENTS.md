# AGENTS.md

Agent guidance for contributors working in this repository.

## Scope

- This file is for work inside this repo, not for downstream Unity projects using the package.
- Follow the closest AGENTS.md if a nested file is added later.
- Explicit user instructions override this file.

## Project Shape

- Unity package and test project live under `Assets/Plugins/UnityCodeMcpServer`.
- Unity tests live under `Assets/Tests` and related test assemblies in the repo root.
- Python STDIO bridge code lives under `Assets/Plugins/UnityCodeMcpServer/Editor/STDIO~/src`.

## Editing Rules

- Make the smallest change that satisfies the request.
- Implement only the changes needed for the task, and finish the requested work before stopping.
- Do not change unrelated code, scenes, assets, or settings.
- Add tests for logic changes unless the change is trivial documentation or rename-only work.
- Keep existing style and naming conventions. In Unity C# code, use snake_case for private fields.
- Prefer latest supported Unity APIs already used by the repo.

## Available Unity Tools

- `execute_csharp_script_in_unity_editor` to run C# scripts in the editor.
- `run_unity_tests` to run Unity tests. Use this tools instead of command-line test runs for Unity-related work.
- `read_unity_console_logs` to read Unity console logs for compile errors.

### Additional Unity Tools

- `play_unity_game` to start Play mode in the Unity editor for testing runtime behavior. You must use `enter_play_mode` before this and `exit_play_mode` after to return to edit mode.

## Unity Workflow

- Before relying on Unity editor tooling, check for compilation problems in Unity logs and fix them first.
- If you edit C# source, validate with relevant Unity tests and re-check logs for compile errors.
- Use `run_unity_tests` for Unity test verification and `read_unity_console_logs` to inspect compile/runtime issues.
- When using `execute_csharp_script_in_unity_editor`, read the bundled `executing-csharp-scripts-in-unity-editor` skill first and treat script execution, console-log checks, and test runs as one workflow.
- Do not use editor-executed C# scripts to edit source files or plain text files; use normal file editing tools for that.

## Verification

- For C# or Python behavior changes, run the narrowest relevant test first, then broaden only if needed.
- For Unity test runs, fail fast on compile issues before assuming a test failure is about logic.
- Do not claim success without fresh verification evidence.

## Documentation

- Update `README.md`, `README_STDIO.md`, release notes, or skill docs when behavior or workflow changes make existing guidance inaccurate.
- Keep AGENTS.md concise. Put detailed end-user explanations in README or skill files instead.

## Dotnet tests

Use `run_unity_tests` tool to run tests in the `Assets/Tests` folder. This will ensure that the Unity editor is properly launched and the test assemblies are correctly loaded. Avoid running dotnet tests directly from the command line, as this may lead to missing dependencies or incorrect test execution context. Always check Unity console logs for any compile errors or test failures after running tests.

## Integration tests

Run `uv run C:\Users\tbory\source\Workspaces\Loop\UnityCodeMcpServer\Dev\Python\mcp_random_tester.py --sequence-length 20 --request-timeout-seconds 180 --workspace-dir .`
