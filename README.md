# Unity Code MCP Server

A direct bridge between your AI agent and Unity. The open-source Unity Code MCP Server gives your agent first-class access to the Unity Editor.<br/>
By executing C# scripts within the Editor, it grants agents direct programmatic access to the Unity Editor API.It transforms your AI into a virtual developer capable of navigating complex hierarchies, authoring scenes, and validating game logic autonomously.

```
Add following feature to Unity using execute script tool:

- Read cities list from csv file #file:cities.csv
- Create CitySO ScriptableObject class with properties based on csv columns, place it in Assets/Scripts/ScriptableObjects
- Create assets for each city in the csv file, populate properties with data from the file, place them in Assets/ScriptableObjects
- Create CityComponent MonoBehaviour class with a reference to CitySO ScriptableObject and place it in Assets/Scripts
- Create Map root gameobject in the current scene
- For each city asset, create a City gameobject as a child of Map, set its position based on the coordinates from the asset, add CityComponent and assign the corresponding CitySO asset
- To each City gameObject add SpriteRenderer component and assign a default sprite from Assets/Images/City.png
```

</details>

<summary><strong>AI Agent Result</strong></summary>

```
Implemented the full “cities from CSV → assets → scene” pipeline.

- Added `CitySO` ScriptableObject: CitySO.cs
- Added `CityComponent` MonoBehaviour: CityComponent.cs
- Added the CSV data file: cities.csv
- Ran an Editor execution script that:
  - Created 49 `CitySO` assets in ScriptableObjects
  - Created a `Map` root GameObject in the active scene with 49 `City` children
  - Set each city position from `Coordinates`, added `CityComponent` and assigned the matching `CitySO`
  - Added `SpriteRenderer` to each city and assigned the default sprite from City.png
```

## Features

**Maximum Project Visibility:**
Gain a 360-degree view of your Unity project. The server lets agents query the active scene hierarchy, inspect serialized component properties, and browse the project asset database.

**Autonomous Scene & Asset Authoring:**
Move from ideation to implementation instantly. Execute C# scripts directly within the Editor to generate GameObjects, attach components, and modify asset parameters on the fly.

**Intelligent Play-Testing & QA:**
The agent can close the feedback loop with automated verification. It can run tests, trigger Playmode, simulate precise player input, and monitor game state in real time.

### Tools

#### execute_csharp_script_in_unity_editor

Perform any task by executing generated C# scripts in Unity Editor context. Full access to UnityEngine, UnityEditor APIs, and reflection. Automatically captures logs, errors, and return values.

#### read_unity_console_logs

Read Unity Editor Console logs with configurable entry limits (1-1000, default 200)

#### run_unity_tests

Run Unity tests via TestRunnerApi. Supports EditMode, PlayMode, or both. Can run all tests or filter by fully qualified test names.

#### enter_play_mode

Enter Unity Play Mode, pause time and return immediately after triggering the transition. Intended to be used before gameplay automation tools.

#### play_unity_game

Temporarily unpause time, simulate configured Input System actions, capture a Game View screenshot, collect logs, and pause again when finished.

#### exit_play_mode

Exit Unity Play Mode, unpause time, and return immediately after triggering the transition.

## Security considerations

This package executes LLM-generated C# code (including reflection code) with the same privileges as the Unity Editor process.

Recommendations:

- Review scripts before executing them.
- Use a separate Unity project and/or run Unity in an isolated environment (VM/container).

You are responsible for securing your environment and for any changes or data loss caused by executed scripts.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Unity 2022.3 LTS or higher (tested on 2022.3.62f3 and 6000.2.7f2)
- UniTask (async/await integration): https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask
- `uv` (Python package manager) for the STDIO transport: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/, RECOMMENDED

### Installation

1. Install `uv` (if using STDIO transport, Recommended):
   - Follow instructions at https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation
2. Install UniTask package in your Unity project:
   - Open Unity Package Manager: **Window > Package Manager**
   - Click the **+** button and select **Add package from git URL...**
   - Enter Git URL

```
https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask.git?path=src/UniTask/Assets/Plugins/UniTask
```

3. Install Unity Code MCP Server package:
   - Open Unity Package Manager: **Window > Package Manager**
   - Click the **+** button and select **Add package from git URL...**

- Enter the Git URL:

```
https://github.com/Signal-Loop/UnityCodeMCPServer.git?path=Assets/Plugins/UnityCodeMcpServer
```

4. Configure Skill install location (Markdown files that teach your agent how to use the server's tools effectively):

- In Unity Editor, open server settings: **Tools/UnityCodeMcpServer/Show or Create Settings**
- Scroll to the **Skills** section
- By default, first-time installs target `.agents/skills/`
- If needed, change the install directory to `.github/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, or a custom folder
- Skills are installed and updated automatically when the package is installed or updated

### First Run

### MCP client configuration

1. Open your Unity project (the STDIO server auto-starts with the Editor).
2. In Unity, run menu item: **Tools/UnityCodeMcpServer/STDIO or HTTP/Print MCP Configuration to Console**.
3. Copy the printed MCP configuration into your MCP client.

#### STDIO

Example configuration (using `uv` to run the bridge):

The `unity-code-mcp-stdio` bridge now forwards STDIO traffic to Unity's Streamable HTTP endpoint and reads the configured `HttpPort` from project settings automatically.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "unity-code-mcp-stdio": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "C:/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/path/to/UnityProject/Assets/Plugins/UnityCodeMcpServer/Editor/STDIO~",
        "unity-code-mcp-stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Streamable HTTP

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "unity-code-mcp-http": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp/",
      "type": "http"
    }
  }
}
```

### Server configuration (Unity)

1. Access (and create if necessary) settings via **Tools/UnityCodeMcpServer/Show or Create Settings**.
2. Configure options:
   - **Server Selection**: Choose STDIO (TCP) or HTTP server for auto-start
   - **Verbose Logging**: Enable detailed logging for debugging

- **TCP Server**: Port (default: `21088`), backlog, timeouts (changing the port restarts the STDIO server if running)
- **HTTP Server**: Port (default: `3001`), session timeout, SSE keep-alive interval (changing the port restarts the HTTP server if running)

### Menu commands

## Agent skills

Unity Code MCP Server ships a set of **AI agent skill files** (Markdown documents that teach your agent how to use the server's tools effectively). These skills are installed automatically into the configured target directory whenever the package is installed or updated.

### Installing skills

1. Open the server settings: **Tools/UnityCodeMcpServer/Show or Create Settings**.
2. Scroll to the **Skills** section.
3. Choose the install directory from the dropdown:

- `GitHub` targets `.github/skills/`
- `Claude` targets `.claude/skills/`
- `Agents` targets `.agents/skills/`
- `Custom` shows a folder picker so you can select any directory

4. The inspector shows the currently selected target directory label so you can verify exactly where skills will be copied.
5. Package install and update runs copy the skills automatically.

Only new or changed `.md` files are copied. Files that are already up to date (matching content hash) are skipped.

### Included skills

| Skill                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Covers forbidden patterns, debugging loops, and common scripting patterns.                                          |
| `unity-game-player`                        | Teaches the agent how to play and test Unity games in a closed loop using `enter_play_mode`, `play_unity_game`, `execute_csharp_script_in_unity_editor`, `read_unity_console_logs`, and `exit_play_mode`. Covers scene discovery, math-based action timing, and adaptive re-sensing. |

## Extending (adding tools)

Add Tools, Prompts, Resources, or Async Tools by implementing the relevant interfaces (ITool, IToolAsync, IPrompt, IResource) anywhere in your codebase. The server will automatically detect and register them.

### Synchronous tool

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text.Json;
using UnityCodeMcpServer.Interfaces;
using UnityCodeMcpServer.Protocol;

public class EchoTool : ITool
{
    public string Name => "echo";

    public string Description => "Echoes the input text back to the caller";

    public JsonElement InputSchema => JsonHelper.ParseElement(@"{
            ""type"": ""object"",
            ""properties"": {
                ""text"": {
                    ""type"": ""string"",
                    ""description"": ""The text to echo""
                }
            },
            ""required"": [""text""]
        }");

    public ToolsCallResult Execute(JsonElement arguments)
    {
        var text = arguments.GetStringOrDefault("text", "");

        return ToolsCallResult.TextResult($"Echo: {text}");
    }
}
```

### Asynchronous tool

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text.Json;
using UnityCodeMcpServer.Interfaces;
using UnityCodeMcpServer.Protocol;
using Cysharp.Threading.Tasks;

public class DelayedEchoTool : IToolAsync
{
    public string Name => "delayed_echo";

    public string Description => "Echoes the input text after a specified delay (demonstrates async tool)";

    public JsonElement InputSchema => JsonHelper.ParseElement(@"{
            ""type"": ""object"",
            ""properties"": {
                ""text"": {
                    ""type"": ""string"",
                    ""description"": ""The text to echo""
                },
                ""delayMs"": {
                    ""type"": ""integer"",
                    ""description"": ""Delay in milliseconds before echoing"",
                    ""default"": 1000
                }
            },
            ""required"": [""text""]
        }");

    public async UniTask<ToolsCallResult> ExecuteAsync(JsonElement arguments)
    {
        var text = arguments.GetStringOrDefault("text", "");
        var delayMs = arguments.GetIntOrDefault("delayMs", 1000);

        await UniTask.Delay(delayMs);

        return ToolsCallResult.TextResult($"Delayed Echo (after {delayMs}ms): {text}");
    }
}
```

## Script execution context

By default, script execution context includes following assemblies:

- Assembly-CSharp
- Assembly-CSharp-Editor
- System.Core
- UnityEngine.CoreModule
- UnityEditor.CoreModule

Unity Code MCP Server settings (Assets/Plugins/UnityCodeMcpServer/Editor/Resources/UnityCodeMcpServerSettings.asset) allow configuring additional assemblies to include in the script execution context. This is useful if your project has assemblies that your generated scripts need to reference.

To add additional assemblies use settings 'Additional Assemblies' section.

![Additional Assemblies](images/UnityCodeMcpServer_Settings_AdditionalAssemblies.png)

## STDIO bridge

See the bridge docs at [README_STDIO.md](README_STDIO.md).

## Testing

Unity tests are in `Assets/Tests/` and can be run via the Unity Test Runner.

## Known Issues

### Assembly-CSharp.dll: Copying the file failed: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.

- This issue may occur when Assembly-CSharp.dll is locked by script execution tool (which loads assemblies) and Unity tries to recompile scripts (which rebuilds Assembly-CSharp.dll). This issue is not solved yet. Workarounds:
  - Change any script to force rebuild, usually adding some spaces or comments is enough. May require multiple attempts.
  - If it still does not work, reopen the project.

### GUID conflicts with existing dll files in the project

- Unity Code MCP Server includes dll files in its package. If those files are already present in your project, you may see GUID conflicts. In our test cases it does not cause any issues, but if you encounter problems, please fill issue: [Issues](https://github.com/Signal-Loop/UnityCodeMCPServer/issues). Removing duplicate dlls from your project may resolve the conflicts.

```
GUID [eb9c83041c7a89c46bb6e20eab4484df] for asset 'Packages/com.signal-loop.unitycodemcpserver/Editor/Bin/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.dll' conflicts with:
  '[Path to dll file in your project]/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.dll' (current owner)
We can't assign a new GUID because the asset is in an immutable folder. The asset will be ignored.
```
