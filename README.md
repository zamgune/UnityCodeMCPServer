# Unity Code MCP Server

## TL;DR

- Connect your MCP client to Unity through the bundled `unity-code-mcp-stdio` bridge.
- Let agents execute C# inside the Unity Editor, read logs, run tests, enter Play Mode, simulate input, and capture Game View screenshots.
- Unity Code MCP Server is designed specifically for long-running agent harness.

Unity Code MCP Server gives AI agents direct access to the Unity Editor through C# execution inside the Editor process. Agents can inspect projects, modify scenes and assets, run tests, and drive Play Mode workflows without custom glue code.

## Features

- **Maximum Project Visibility:** Inspect the active scene, components, and project assets from an MCP client.
- **Autonomous Scene & Asset Authoring:** Create and modify GameObjects, prefabs, ScriptableObjects, and other Unity assets by executing C# in the Editor.
- **Intelligent Play-Testing & QA:** Run Edit Mode and Play Mode tests, enter Play Mode, simulate input, capture screenshots, and read Unity console logs.

### Tools

#### execute_csharp_script_in_unity_editor

Perform any task by executing generated C# scripts in Unity Editor context. Full access to UnityEngine, UnityEditor APIs, and reflection. Automatically captures logs, errors, and return values.

#### read_unity_console_logs

Read Unity Editor Console logs with configurable entry limits (1-1000, default 200)

#### run_unity_tests

Run Unity tests via TestRunnerApi. Supports EditMode, PlayMode, or both. Can run all tests or filter by fully qualified test names.

#### enter_play_mode

Enter Unity Play Mode, pause time and return immediately after triggering the transition. Intended to be used before gameplay automation tools.

#### play_unity_game

Temporarily unpause time, simulate configured Input System actions, collect logs, and pause again when finished.

#### get_unity_game_view_window_screenshot

Capture the current Unity Game View as an image without routing screenshot capture through gameplay input calls.

#### exit_play_mode

Exit Unity Play Mode, unpause time, and return immediately after triggering the transition.

#### get_unity_info

Returns information about the current Unity Editor project and the UnityCodeMcpServer settings.

## Security considerations

This package executes LLM-generated C# code (including reflection code) with the same privileges as the Unity Editor process.

Recommendations:

- Review scripts before executing them.
- Use a separate Unity project and/or run Unity in an isolated environment (VM/container).

You are responsible for securing your environment and for any changes or data loss caused by executed scripts.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Unity 2022.3 LTS or higher (tested on 2022.3.62f3 and 6000.2.7f2)
- UniTask (async/await integration): https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask
- `uv` (Python package manager) for the bundled STDIO bridge: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/.

### Installation

1. Install `uv`:
   - Follow instructions at https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation
2. Install UniTask in your Unity project. Open **Window > Package Manager**, click the **+** button, select **Add package from git URL...**, and enter:

```
https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask.git?path=src/UniTask/Assets/Plugins/UniTask
```

3. Install Unity Code MCP Server from Unity Package Manager. Open **Window > Package Manager**, click the **+** button, select **Add package from git URL...**, and enter:

```
https://github.com/Signal-Loop/UnityCodeMCPServer.git?path=Assets/Plugins/UnityCodeMcpServer
```

4. Configure the skill install location. Open **Tools/UnityCodeMcpServer/Show or Create Settings**, scroll to the **Skills** section, and confirm or change the install directory. By default, first-time installs target `.agents/skills/`. Skills are installed and updated automatically when the package is installed or updated.

### First Run

### MCP client configuration

1. Open your Unity project. Unity auto-starts the file-backed transport and watches `.unityCodeMcpServer/messages` in the project root.
2. Configure your MCP client to run the bundled STDIO bridge.

#### STDIO

Example configuration (using `uv` to run the bridge):

The `unity-code-mcp-stdio` bridge forwards STDIO traffic to Unity through `.unityCodeMcpServer/messages`.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "unity-code-mcp-stdio": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "C:/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/path/to/UnityProject/Assets/Plugins/UnityCodeMcpServer/Editor/STDIO~",
        "unity-code-mcp-stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Server configuration (Unity)

1. Access the settings via **Tools/UnityCodeMcpServer/Show or Create Settings**.
2. Configure **Verbose Logging** for detailed diagnostics and optionally set **Input Actions Asset** for `play_unity_game`.

The file-backed transport exchanges request and response files through `.unityCodeMcpServer/messages` in the Unity project root.

### Menu commands

#### General

- **Tools/UnityCodeMcpServer/Show or Create Settings** — Open the server settings asset in the inspector


## Agent skills

Unity Code MCP Server ships a set of **AI agent skill files** (Markdown documents that teach your agent how to use the server's tools effectively). These skills are installed automatically into the configured target directory whenever the package is installed or updated.

### Installing skills

1. Open the server settings: **Tools/UnityCodeMcpServer/Show or Create Settings**.
2. Scroll to the **Skills** section.
3. Choose the install directory from the dropdown:

- `GitHub` targets `.github/skills/`
- `Claude` targets `.claude/skills/`
- `Agents` targets `.agents/skills/`
- `Custom` shows a folder picker so you can select any directory

4. The inspector shows the currently selected target directory label so you can verify exactly where skills will be copied.
5. Package install and update runs copy the skills automatically.

Only new or changed `.md` files are copied. Files that are already up to date (matching content hash) are skipped.

### Included skills

| Skill                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `executing-csharp-scripts-in-unity-editor` | Teaches the agent when and how to use `execute_csharp_script_in_unity_editor`, `read_unity_console_logs`, and `run_unity_tests` together as a reliable pipeline. Covers forbidden patterns, debugging loops, and common scripting patterns.                                          |
| `unity-game-player`                        | Teaches the agent how to play and test Unity games in a closed loop using `enter_play_mode`, `play_unity_game`, `execute_csharp_script_in_unity_editor`, `read_unity_console_logs`, and `exit_play_mode`. Covers scene discovery, math-based action timing, and adaptive re-sensing. |

## Extending (adding tools)

Add Tools, Prompts, Resources, or Async Tools by implementing the relevant interfaces (ITool, IToolAsync, IPrompt, IResource) anywhere in your codebase. The server will automatically detect and register them.

### Synchronous tool

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text.Json;
using UnityCodeMcpServer.Interfaces;
using UnityCodeMcpServer.Protocol;

public class EchoTool : ITool
{
    public string Name => "echo";

    public string Description => "Echoes the input text back to the caller";

    public JsonElement InputSchema => JsonHelper.ParseElement(@"{
            ""type"": ""object"",
            ""properties"": {
                ""text"": {
                    ""type"": ""string"",
                    ""description"": ""The text to echo""
                }
            },
            ""required"": [""text""]
        }");

    public ToolsCallResult Execute(JsonElement arguments)
    {
        var text = arguments.GetStringOrDefault("text", "");

        return ToolsCallResult.TextResult($"Echo: {text}");
    }
}
```

### Asynchronous tool

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text.Json;
using UnityCodeMcpServer.Interfaces;
using UnityCodeMcpServer.Protocol;
using Cysharp.Threading.Tasks;

public class DelayedEchoTool : IToolAsync
{
    public string Name => "delayed_echo";

    public string Description => "Echoes the input text after a specified delay (demonstrates async tool)";

    public JsonElement InputSchema => JsonHelper.ParseElement(@"{
            ""type"": ""object"",
            ""properties"": {
                ""text"": {
                    ""type"": ""string"",
                    ""description"": ""The text to echo""
                },
                ""delayMs"": {
                    ""type"": ""integer"",
                    ""description"": ""Delay in milliseconds before echoing"",
                    ""default"": 1000
                }
            },
            ""required"": [""text""]
        }");

    public async UniTask<ToolsCallResult> ExecuteAsync(JsonElement arguments)
    {
        var text = arguments.GetStringOrDefault("text", "");
        var delayMs = arguments.GetIntOrDefault("delayMs", 1000);

        await UniTask.Delay(delayMs);

        return ToolsCallResult.TextResult($"Delayed Echo (after {delayMs}ms): {text}");
    }
}
```

## Script execution context

By default, script execution context includes following assemblies:

- Assembly-CSharp
- Assembly-CSharp-Editor
- System.Core
- UnityEngine.CoreModule
- UnityEditor.CoreModule

Unity Code MCP Server settings (Assets/Plugins/UnityCodeMcpServer/Editor/Resources/UnityCodeMcpServerSettings.asset) allow configuring additional assemblies to include in the script execution context. This is useful if your project has assemblies that your generated scripts need to reference.

To add additional assemblies use settings 'Additional Assemblies' section.

![Additional Assemblies](images/UnityCodeMcpServer_Settings_AdditionalAssemblies.png)

## STDIO bridge

See the bridge docs at [README_STDIO.md](README_STDIO.md).

## Testing

Unity tests are in `Assets/Tests/` and can be run via the Unity Test Runner.

## Known Issues

### GUID conflicts with existing dll files in the project

- Unity Code MCP Server includes dll files in its package. If those files are already present in your project, you may see GUID conflicts. In our test cases it does not cause any issues, but if you encounter problems, please fill issue: [Issues](https://github.com/Signal-Loop/UnityCodeMCPServer/issues). Removing duplicate dlls from your project may resolve the conflicts.

```
GUID [eb9c83041c7a89c46bb6e20eab4484df] for asset 'Packages/com.signal-loop.unitycodemcpserver/Editor/Bin/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.dll' conflicts with:
  '[Path to dll file in your project]/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.dll' (current owner)
We can't assign a new GUID because the asset is in an immutable folder. The asset will be ignored.
```
